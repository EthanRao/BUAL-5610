    "Pandas is a library that unifies the most common workflows that data analysts and data scientists previously relied on many different libraries for. Pandas has quickly became an important tool in a data professional's toolbelt and is the most popular library for working with tabular data in Python. Tabular data is any data that can be represented as rows and columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "To represent tabular data, Pandas uses a custom data structure called a **DataFrame**. A DataFrame is a highly efficient, 2-dimensional data structure that provides a suite of methods and attributes to quickly explore, analyze, and visualize data. The DataFrame object is similar to the NumPy 2D array but adds support for many features that help you work with tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest advantages that Pandas has over NumPy is the ability to store mixed data types in rows and columns. Many tabular datasets contain a range of data types and Pandas DataFrames handle mixed data types effortlessly while NumPy doesn't. Pandas DataFrames can also handle missing values gracefully using a custom object, **NaN**, to represent those values. A common complaint with NumPy is its lack of an object to represent missing values and people end up having to find and replace these values manually. In addition, Pandas DataFrames contain axis labels for both rows and columns and enable you to refer to elements in the DataFrame more intuitively. Since many tabular datasets contain column titles, this means that DataFrames preserve the metadata from the file around the data.\n",

    "To select multiple columns, pass in a list of strings representing the column names and Pandas will return a DataFrame containing only the values in those columns. The following code returns a DataFrame containing the \"Zinc_(mg)\" and \"Copper_(mg)\" columns, in that order:\n",

    "    columns = [\"Zinc_(mg)\", \"Copper_(mg)\"]\n",

    "When selecting multiple columns, the order of the columns in the returned DataFrame matches the order of the column names in the list of strings that you passed in. This allows you to easily explore specific columns that may not be positioned next to each other in the DataFrame.\n",
