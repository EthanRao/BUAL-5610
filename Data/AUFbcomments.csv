What does that prove? That skill is not useful in any other situation. It could just as easily be a contest to see which group of seven people can stack cardboard boxes the fastest.

Wisconsin is undefeated with a lackluster schedule, which is why they're at #3 and not at #1.

Georgia Southern: we moved the ball and put up decent numbers. The o-line was inconsistent but overall, we did what we had to do.

Clemson: we lost to the defending national champion by 8 points. Our O was nonexistent for 75% of the game but we moved the ball well the first couple of drives. Our D was outstanding and kept us in the game. I think they simply got wore out like several times last season AND how Clemson beat Alabama.

Mercer: not the best showing we've ever had but let's just assume we don't turn the ball over 5 times and we score, say 24 pts (complete guess) then we score 48 total pts. The coaching staff can't make the players hold on to the ball.

Here's the thing. We can't fault Gus for being what he is. He is a HS coach and a decent OC. Not a head coach. The problem here lies deeper than Gus. The ultimate problem is the same one we have had for quiet some time, Jay Jacobs. Until Jay is gone, we are going to have to put up with people like Chiz and Gus. It's not their fault. They are doing what they know to do but unfortunately that's not working. Think about the last time we really had a good thing going for us. Who was our coach? Tubs.

Improvement needs to be made in the receiving corps regarding getting open early and on special teams.  The Clemson game will be a hard fought battle, and we cannot afford turnovers.
