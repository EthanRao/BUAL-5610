Predictive Modeling II

## COURSE DESCRIPTION & OBJECTIVES
As computing power has dramatically improved over the last decade, many new, highly computational, predictive methods have been developed. Since these methods are so new, the business community is generally unaware of their huge potential. This course aims to go beyond the traditional regression method and to provide a much applied overview to those modern predictive methods, such as Random Forest, Boosting and Bagging, Neural network and deep learning, and Support Vector Machines.

We will cover these approaches in the context of Marketing, Finance and other important business decisions. At the end of this course, you should have a basic understanding of how these methods work and are able to apply them in real business situations. To this end, I design the course in the following ways.

  + It is NOT a computer science/statistical course with a focus on theoretical derivations.
  
  + It introduces a wealth of doable examples come from a broad section of industries.
  
  + It is a course that provides hands-on experience, but at the same time offers ample explanation of what one is doing.


The course will be covered with industry data sets/cases, e.g., Twitter tweets, Facebook fan page comments, stock market price, risk assessment, housing valuation. Upon the completion of this course, you are expected to have truly innovative and important applied skills to market and differentiate yourself with. People with predictive modeling skills are in high demand!

## Exams

There will be two take-home exams throughout the semester. Students typically have one week to work on the exams independently. Each exam consists of multiple choices, short essay questions, and coding tasks. No late submissions of take-home exams will be accepted.

## Homework

There are five homework assignments. Each assignment will involve answering a real application problem. The instructor will provide the necessary data sets and explain the business problem for each assignment.
